Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into the release cycle, releases will be numbered with the follow format:

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
